this is a readme for the dotfiles repo!

dotfiles repo is a bare repo, see this article for setup
https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/dotfiles

quick summary:
* use dotfiles EXACTLY AS THEY WOULD BE without any source control tracking
* config (alias in bash to git) controls the .dotfiles repo
* it can do all the things regular git can, but the files it tracks ARE NOT STORED IN .dotfiles!!
* because it is a bare repo, it will track files outside of itself
* and we use that capability to track our "dot" files.  including this one!
