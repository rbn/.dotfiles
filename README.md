# .dotfiles

- This README is stored in the home directory, but is managed by the .dotfiles repo
- set up via this article - https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/dotfiles
- quick usage: use "config" instead of "git" command, that will commit files to the dotfiles repo


notes:
- This is for singular dot files
- Config files in .config (e.g., nvim) need their own repos, bc as of now I can't get this repo to take in subdirectories within the home directory
